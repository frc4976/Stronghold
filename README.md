### __Description__

---
Our software is aimed to provide an intuitive set of controls for our drivers. We have accomplished this by making most of the systems on our robot semi-automated. Providing the driver with simplistic controls such as "aim", "shoot", and "pick up ball". these function control all of the pneumatics and motors are handled in software to allow the driver to think about driving, not how long he needs to spin the intake.

### __Installation__

---
Intellij IDEA being our preferred development environment here are a few simple steps to get you started programming for FIRST Robotics Competitions. It's recommended that you read through once first so you don't miss anything.


1. If you haven't already follow the wpilib documentation to install your development tools. which can be found [here.](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/145002-installing-eclipse-c-java)  


2. then make sure you've download and installed intell Intellij IDEA Community from [here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/specials/idea/idea.html?&gclid=Cj0KEQiA3t-2BRCKivi-suDY24gBEiQAX1wiXDi97R7ffOx9aprOyzlWizkZfSgI7PYjaRnOnGAp6TsaAlXF8P8HAQ&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CIuyoL_9pcsCFcRxAQodelYP2g#chooseYourEdition)



3. clone the project to your preferred directory. step for using git can be found [here.](https://help.github.com/)

6. Click next a few times the default settings will work fine. Feel free to mess around and make it feel a little more personal.

7. Next we are going to setup the project for development first we need to tell intellij what to build right click on the build.xml file and mark it as ant build file.

8. Now we need to tell IDEA where all of our libraries are this can be done by pressing (ctrl + alt + shift + s) then navigating to modules -> dependencies.

9. Clicking the small plus sign beside the word scope (as shown above) allows us to add external libraries to the build path. We will navigate to C:\Users\"your username"\wpilib\java\current\ and select the following and click ok.

10. Great! Now you'll just have to click apply and ok and your ready to develop.
